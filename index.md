## [The Milo Project](https://4and4.github.io/)

The Milo IDE is a web based platform targetted at students who wish to learn concepts of Machine Learning and Linear Algebra, with no prior programming experience. The IDE is designed to support introductory level Data Science, ML and Linear Algebra courses typically taught at undergraduate programs.

#### [Milo Server](https://github.com/4and4/MiloServer)

Milo Server is the main ExpressJS backend server that will be hosting the Milo IDE and the associated backend for managing interactions to the Milo Server from the IDE. 

#### [Milo Blocks](https://github.com/4and4/milo-blocks)

Milo Blocks is a fork of Google's Blockly that has been modified to work as a node-module. Milo Blocks consists of custom block implementations for the Milo IDE. 


## [Github Issue Tracker](https://github.com/googlecloudplatform/issuetracker)

Github Issue Tracker is a web application hosted on Google Cloud Platform that provides consolidated email digests of issues on GitHub repositories. I worked on this as part of my Summer Internship at [Google, SF](https://cloud.google.com/) on the Cloud DPE Team. The tool demonstrates integration of various App Engine features along with other Google Services such as BigQuery, Firebase, and Cloud SQL, and building an app using a Microservices Architecture in Go.
