# About Me

I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at the [University of Colorado, Boulder](https://colorado.edu) and a teaching assistant for CSCI 1300: Starting Computing. I work with Dr.Sidney D'Mello at the [Emotive Computing Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/sidneydmello/emotive-computing-lab) on modelling Collaborative Problem Solving discourse through Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning techniques.


My research interests include Natural Language Processing, Applied Machine Learning and Human Computer Interaction.

I have one year of full time work experience at [Stride.ai](https://stride.ai) as an NLP Engineer, where I worked on building machine learning models for tasks like Document Classification, Document Clustering, Information Extraction, etc. as well as building end to end web applications supporting these ML solutions, that include interactive visualizations and tools for providing feedback on model predictions. I have also interned at Microsoft (Redmond), and Google (San Francisco). 

I received my Bachelor of Engineering Degree in Information Science and Engineering from [Ramaiah Institute of Technology](http://msrit.edu/) (2014-2018).

# Projects

## [The Milo Project](https://miloide.github.io/)

The Milo IDE is a web based platform targetted at students who wish to learn concepts of Machine Learning and Linear Algebra, with no prior programming experience. The IDE is designed to support introductory level Data Science, ML and Linear Algebra courses typically taught at undergraduate programs.


#### [Milo Blocks](https://github.com/miloide/milo-blocks)

Milo Blocks is a fork of Google's Blockly that has been modified to work as a node-module. Milo Blocks consists of custom block implementations for the Milo IDE.


## [Github Issue Tracker](https://github.com/googlecloudplatform/issuetracker)

Github Issue Tracker is a web application hosted on Google Cloud Platform that provides consolidated email digests of issues on GitHub repositories. I worked on this as part of my Summer Internship at [Google, SF](https://cloud.google.com/) on the Cloud DPE Team. The tool demonstrates integration of various App Engine features along with other Google Services such as BigQuery, Firebase, and Cloud SQL, and building an app using a Microservices Architecture in Go.
